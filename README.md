# Quantitative-Data-Analysis-Project-2

### An analysis of the difference between the effect of visual interruptions and the effect of audio interruptions on participant's Tetris gameplay performance

Welcome to the Quantitative Data Analysis project, conducted as part of the coursework at University College Dublin (UCD). This project aims to unravel the intriguing dynamics between cognitive task performance and interruptions, specifically focusing on the effects of visual and audio interruptions on participants' Tetris gameplay. Through meticulous data analysis and robust statistical techniques, our goal is to gain deeper insights into how these interruptions influence gameplay outcomes.

### Project Overview

In this assignment paper, we delve into the world of cognitive multitasking by investigating the impact of visual and audio interruptions on Tetris gameplay performance. By employing advanced quantitative methodologies, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations within the data, contributing to a better understanding of human attention and cognitive load management.

### Purpose and Objectives

The primary purpose of this project is to analyze and compare the effects of two distinct types of interruptions (visual and audio) on Tetris gameplay performance. The project seeks to address the following key objectives:

Data Reading and Cleaning: Reading in the Tetris gameplay dataset, examining its structure, and performing necessary data cleaning steps to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating descriptive statistics for the overall Tetris scores and scores under each interruption condition, providing a comprehensive summary of the data.
Data Visualization: Creating informative visualizations, including box plots and histograms, to gain insights into the distribution of Tetris scores and any potential trends between different conditions.
Assumption Testing: Conducting the Shapiro-Wilk's test and Levene's test to validate the assumptions required for subsequent inferential analysis.
Inferential Statistics: Performing a t-test to determine the statistical significance of differences in Tetris gameplay performance between the two interruption conditions.
Discussion and Interpretation: Analyzing the results, discussing their implications, and drawing connections to existing literature on cognitive task performance and interruptions.

### Methodology and R Code

The project follows a systematic methodology, as demonstrated through the provided R code. Here's a brief breakdown of the steps executed in the R code:

Data Reading and Cleaning: The dataset is read, and an initial exploration of the data is conducted by inspecting the head and tail of the dataframe. Data cleaning involves identifying and handling impossible scores and outliers.
Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are calculated for the overall Tetris scores and for each interruption condition. This step provides valuable insights into the central tendencies, variability, and other key metrics of the data.
Data Visualization: Box plots and histograms are generated to visualize the distribution of Tetris scores under different conditions, aiding in identifying potential patterns and differences.
Assumption Testing: The assumptions required for a t-test are validated using the Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality and the Levene's test for homogeneity of variances.
Inferential Statistics: A t-test is conducted to compare the means of Tetris scores between auditory and visual interruption conditions. The results are interpreted to assess the statistical significance of the observed differences.
Data Interpretation: The findings are interpreted and discussed, drawing connections to established research and theories related to cognitive multitasking, attention, and interruptions.

### Conclusion

Through comprehensive quantitative data analysis, this project strives to enhance our understanding of how visual and audio interruptions impact Tetris gameplay performance. By unearthing key insights from the data and connecting them with established knowledge, we contribute to the broader field of cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction.
